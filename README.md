Created by **Chaitanya Kumar Sathivada**.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Smart Folder Logic:** Automatically creates sub-folders for playlists while keeping single video downloads clean in the root directory (eliminates the "NA" folder bug).
- **Dynamic Path Detection:** Automatically identifies the current Windows User profile to set the default `Downloads` path.
- **Embedded Metadata:** Full support for embedding thumbnails, artist information, and media tags directly into the files.
- **Optimized Modes:**
  - **Option 1 (MP3):** High-fidelity audio extraction with metadata.
  - **Option 2 (MP4):** Video downloads recoded for maximum compatibility.
  - **Option 3 (Art):** Extracts high-resolution album/video cover art only.
- **In-App Settings:** Update your download destination on the fly without restarting the toolkit.
- **Looping Workflow:** Stay within your selected mode to paste multiple URLs; use `/back` to return to the main menu.

## 🎨 Visual Interface

The toolkit uses a restricted high-contrast color scheme:
- **RED:** System branding, ASCII Logo, Borders, and UI Accents.
- **WHITE:** User Inputs, URL prompts, Success messages, and Credits.
- **BLACK:** Command-line background.
